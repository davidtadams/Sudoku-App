          <h4>Welcome to my Sudoku Game!</h4>
          <h3>Sudoku Rules</h3>
          <ul class="">
            <li>Every board has 9 regions, each region has 9 cells</li>
            <li>Each individual region must contain the numbers 1-9</li>
            <li>Each row on the board must contain the numbers 1-9</li>
            <li>Each column on the board must also contain the numbers 1-9</li>
            <li>Thus, the board can only contain the number 1 through 9</li>
            <li>Pretty simple right? Play on!</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Navigating the page</h3>
          <ul class="no-bullet">
            <li>You can navigate around the board with your arrow keys
            or click on a cell to select it. Tip: You normally have to click on a
            cell on the board before you can use the arrow keys.</li>
            <li>In order to enter in a number, all you have to do is type that
            number on your keyboad.</li>
            <li>If you enter a number by mistake or want to change a number, then
            you can hit the Backspace, Escape, Delete, 0, or Space keys in order
            to delete that number. Just navigate to the cell you want to delete
            and then delete it.</li>
            <li>There is a timer that automatically starts for you. If the timer
            makes you too anxious, you can just click on it and it will stop.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>By default, an easy puzzle is loaded. In order to change puzzle
            difficulties, use the top easy, medium, and hard buttons.</li>
            <li>At any time, you can click the view solution button to view the
            solution for the current puzzle.</li>
            <li>If you made a mistake or just want to start over, you can
            click the reset board button. WARNING! This will clear the board
            and delete your progress. If you just made one mistake, remember
            that you can just delete that number, you don't need to reset
            the board.</li>
            <li>If you want to save a game and resume it later, you can click
            the save game button. Then, when you come back to the site, you will
            see a prompt asking you if you want to resume your game. If you
            want to resume it, just click yes at that prompt.</li>
            <li>If you have no intention of resuming your saved game and want
            that prompt to go away, just click delete game.</li>
            <li>If you want to try out a new puzzle of the same difficulty that
            you are currently on, you can click new puzzle.</li>
            <li>At any point during your game, you can switch on live error
            checking. This will highlight any errors that you make or have made
            with a red box. You can just leave it on or use it to periodically
            check your status.</li>
            <li>When you complete a puzzle, an alert will tell you whether or not
            your solution is correct.</li>
            <li>All of the alerts that show up in the site will disable after a
            couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>The number status bar under the board will change colors for
            numbers that have been completed in the puzzle. Meaning there are no
            more of those numbers to enter.</li>
            <li>All of the puzzles are randomly pulled from an API that I created.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This application was created as my first major project while attending
            <a href="http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/">Galvanize's Full Stack Program.</a>
            The goal of the project was to practice front-end development. The
            application was made over a period of 4 days.
